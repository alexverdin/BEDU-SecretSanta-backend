# Halloween version of "secret santa"

## Getting Started
- git clone
- npm install
- ... (?)

## Description:
This app allows you to create an exchange group with a list of guests among whom gifts will be given secretly, using halloween as the main theme.
Two roles (for now) are handled: Participant and Organizer.
Deadlines are established in each activity: Union of participants with time to create each one's "wishlist", draw date and exchange date.
Each participant can create their wish list and edit it as much as they want, as long as it is before the date of the draw (to avoid that once the draw is done, the user changes their
opinion about her gifts).

## Characteristics:
- Registration of new users
- Participants can see at all times who they will give their gift to, as well as their wishlist.
- The Organizers may or may not be Participants.
- The app is designed not to "close" exchanges, so that the exchange always ends with the last participant giving their gift to the first.
- At the time the organizer carries out the draw, the possibility of adding new users and/or editing the wishlist will be eliminated (showing a warning prior to the execution of the draw).
- In the wishlist it is allowed to add URLs and images of the gift in order to facilitate the search for it by the participants.
